Most common types of protein secondary structures are alpha helicces and beta sheets. Other helices also exist (3_10 helix, pi helix) but are rare. There are also random coils.


DSSP Classification

DSSP, the directory of protein secondary structure, is commonly used to describe protein secondary structure with letter codes. There are eight types of secondary structure in the DSSP:

G --- 3 turn helix 3_10 helix. Minimum length, 3 residues
H --- 4 turn helix, alpha helix, minimum length 4 residues.
I --- 5 turn helix, pi helix, minimum length 5 residues.
T --- Hydrogen bonded turn, 3, 4, or 5 turn
E --- extended strand in parallel and/or anti-parallel B-sheet conformation. minimum length, 2 residues
B --- Residue in isolated B-bridge
S --- Bend (the only non-hydrogen bond assignment)
C --- Coil (residues which are not in any of the above conformations)
